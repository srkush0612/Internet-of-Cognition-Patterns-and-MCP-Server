/**
 * The 23 interaction patterns, from `context.md` section 7.
 *
 * 33 originals, 17 IOC patterns and 16 SDK components, deduplicated into 23.
 * A component is the `implementation` of a pattern, not a separate entry, so
 * there is one list here and not two.
 *
 * What is grounded and what is synthesis:
 *
 *   grounded    name, source, merged_from, evidence, level notes, triggers and
 *               channels for the IOC entries, which come from the published
 *               pattern pages. Summaries for IOC entries are their published
 *               one-liners, trimmed.
 *   synthesis   primary and secondary modes, primary level, the spec sentence,
 *               audiences, and channels for the SDK entries. Section 9 of the
 *               document lists the specific calls that need validating, and
 *               `judgment-calls.ts` carries that list into the UI.
 *
 * `composes_with` and `conflicts_with` are empty everywhere. The document
 * defines the fields but supplies no values, and a composition graph invented
 * here would read as a finding. TODO: author these.
