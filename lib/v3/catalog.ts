/**
 * The v3 catalog mirrors the broader AI-UX pattern map from Nucleux so we do
 * not lose that knowledge, while keeping HAX's own agentic patterns as the
 * identity of the library.
 *
 * Two kinds of entries:
 *   agentic   HAX's own agent-coordination patterns. The 23 existing v2
 *             patterns stay unchanged and are referenced here by id. Seven
 *             additional agent-side patterns (Stream of Thought, Follow Up,
 *             Memory, and the four Task patterns) are declared inline.
 *             Agentic entries carry the HAX behavior spec and 4 dimensions of
 *             participation, which the Agentic view's filters use.
 *   general   The rest of the Nucleux map: non-agentic AI-UX patterns kept as
 *             reference entries so the library documents the whole surface.
 *             They carry only the lighter schema: name, summary, stage, and
 *             cluster. No behavior spec, no dimension.
 *
 * Nothing here changes any v2 file.
