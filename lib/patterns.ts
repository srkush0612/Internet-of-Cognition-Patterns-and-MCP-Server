      "The same person wants opposite things at different moments. Mid-task they want less to read so they can keep working. In review they want all of it, because the detail is the only thing that explains what happened. Most tools pick one level and keep it there.",
    interactionModel:
      "The interaction is the switch between the two modes. While the task is live, the agent shows a status line, the next step, and a count of what it has recorded but is not showing, so nothing looks hidden by accident. When the task closes, that count becomes the way in. The record opens to a timeline of what the agent did, which tools it called, and the points where its read of the situation changed. Both modes hold the same data. Only the amount shown moves.",
    whereItEmbeds:
      "The component belongs wherever the work is being watched while it happens, which is usually an incident console or an on-call inbox, and then again wherever that work is reviewed afterwards, usually the incident page or a weekly review. It pairs with Disclosure Gradient, which solves the same problem from the other side: that one holds detail back until someone asks, this one holds it back until the work is done.",
